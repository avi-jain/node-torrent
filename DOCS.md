_dgram send()_ -> socket.send(msg, [offset, length,] port, address[, callback])

_rinfo_ -> object with the sender's address information provided -> address family port:

_Buffer copy()_ -> buf.copy(targetBuffer[, targetStart[, sourceStart[, sourceEnd]]])
buf.writeUInt32BE(value, offset[, noAssert])#

buf.writeUInt32LE(value, offset[, noAssert])
buf.writeUInt32BE(value, offset[, noAssert])

value <Integer> Number to be written to buf
offset <Integer> Where to start writing. Must satisfy: 0 <= offset <= buf.length - 4
noAssert <Boolean> Skip value and offset validation? Default: false
Return: <Integer> offset plus the number of bytes written

####The format of the connreq is made so because each hexadecimal represents 4 bits and node cannot handle precise 64 bit ints.

####The number of addresses returned in the announce response is not constant.

While calculating torrent size, there are two cases we have to consider - torrents that have one file or more than one file. If the torrent only has one file then we can get itâ€™s size in the torrent.info.length property. But if it has multiple files, it will have a torrent.info.files property instead which is an array of objects for each file. We have to iterate over these file objects and sum their length property.
